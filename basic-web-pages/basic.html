        <h1>Internating is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>Heading define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>This is how you make an unordered lists:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element </li>
            <li>The don't need to be any particular order.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This is what an ordered list look like.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
            <li>But, the list item element are the same</li>
            <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own.</li>
            <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list.</li>
        </ol>
